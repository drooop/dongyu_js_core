# Dongyu Project Lexicon

- Read `skills/dongyu-project-lexicon/LEXICON.md` before any terminology-sensitive work.
- Treat `LEXICON.md` as the single source of truth for term definitions and boundaries inside this repo.
- If a term is missing or inconsistent, update `LEXICON.md` first and document the current observable behavior.
- Record ambiguities under “Open / Unclear Semantics” instead of inventing new meanings.
- If `LEXICON.md` conflicts with `docs/architecture_mantanet_and_workers.md`, treat `docs/architecture_mantanet_and_workers.md` as higher priority SSOT.
